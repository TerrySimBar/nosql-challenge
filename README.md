#### Introduction
This NoSQL project demonstrates skills to create a restaurant database with a JSON file via Terminal, and use PyMongo in a Jupyter Notebook to make changes in the database as well as make queries for insightful analysis.


#### Features
- Create databse via Terminal. 

- Insert, update, and delete documents from the database. 

- Convert  datatypes in the database. 

- Use Regex/create pipelines.

- Create DataFrame from query results. 

<br>

#### Requirements & Dependencies
You will need the following software to run the two Jupyter Notebook scripts:
- Python 3.10
- Pandas
- PyMongo
- Pretty Print
<br>

## Project Structure
<br>

## **Part 1.** 
##### Database and Jupyter Notebook Setup
<br>
1. Import dependencies and create an instance of MongoClient. 
<br>
<br>
2. Navigate to Resources folder and type 'mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray establishments.json' to create and load the uk_food database.
<br>
<br>
3. Check that the 'uk_food' database was created with the 'establishments' collection.

<br>
<img src = "Images/collectn_creatd.png" width="600"/>
<br>
<br>

4. Review one document in the collection.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **Part 2.** 
##### Update the Database
<br>
1. Create a dictionary for a new restaraunt 'Penang Flavours' and insert the restaurant into the collection. 
<img src = "Images/print_penang.png" width="900"/>
<br>
<br>

2. Check ten restaurants to determine the 'BusinessTypeID' for 'Restaurant/Cafe/Canteen'.
<img src = "Images/bus_type_id.png" width="800"/>
<br>
<br>

3. Update Penang Flavours' Business Type ID, and check the document. 
<img src = "Images/update_Penang.png" width="1000"/>
<br>
<br>

4. i. Check the number of documents with 'Dover' as the local authority. 
<img src = "Images/num_dover_docs.png" width="100"/>
<br>
<br> ii. Drop all the documents with 'Dover' as the local authority. 
<br>
<br> iii. Check that there are no documents remaining with 'Dover' as the local authority.
<img src = "Images/check_num_dover_docs.png" width="100"/>
<br>
<br>
iv. Use 'find_one' to check that documents are remaining in the database. 
<img src = "Images/docs_remain.png" width="900"/>
<br>
<br>
5. i. Use `update_many` to convert `latitude` and `longitude` to decimal numbers.
<br>
ii. Use `update_many` to set non 1-5 rating values to null. 
<br>
iii. Use 'update_many' to convert rating value data type to integer.  
<br>
iv. Check that the coordinates and rating values are now numeric.

<br>

## **Part 3.** 
##### Exploratory Analysis
<br>
1.
<br>
i. Query how many restaurants have a hygiene score of 20. 
<img src = "Images/num_hyg.png" width="900"/>
<br>
<br>

ii. Print out the first restaurant in the query. 
<img src = "Images/first_hyg.png" width="900"/> 
<br>
<br>

iii. Create a DataFrame from the query and check the length and head. 
<img src = "Images/hyg_df.png" width="1200"/> 
<br>
<br>

2.
<br>
i. Query how many restaurants in London have a `RatingValue` greater than or equal to 4?
<br>
<img src = "Images/num_lndn_4.png" width="100"/> 
<br>
<br>

ii. Print out the first restaurant in the query. 
<img src = "Images/first_lndn_4.png" width="900"/> 
<br>
<br>

iii. Create a DataFrame from the query and check the length and head. 
<img src = "Images/lndn_4_len_head.png" width="1600"/> 
<br>
<br>

3.
<br>
i. Query the top 5 establishments with a rating value of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to Penang Flavours. 
<br>
ii. Print the results, then create a DataFrame.
<br>
<img src = "Images/near_penang_top5.png" width="900"/> 
<br>
<br>

4.
ii. Use a pipeline to find out how many establishments in each local authority have a hygiene score of zero? 
<img src = "Images/zero_hyg_loc_auth.png" width="700"/> 
<br>
<br>

iii. Create a DataFrame from the query and check the length and head. 
<img src = "Images/zero_hyg_df.png" width="600"/> 
<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Usage
1. Set up all software requirements 
2. Ensure that you have the appropriate JSON file to create the database.
3. Run the setup script first, and then the analysis script step by step in Jupyter Notebook. 
- Be careful when running the scripts to avoid over-querying the database.
